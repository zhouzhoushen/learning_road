Don't be intimidated by dazzling decorations. It's just a markdown file strictly follow markdown grammar. (Sometimes may have HTML content.)

For example, a beautiful badge is essentially a hyperlink represented by an image. And the image is generated by some web servers. 

So you can use 

```markdown
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ZhiHu-black?style=flat-square&logo=zhihu&logoColor=white)](https://www.zhihu.com/)
```

to generate badges like this:

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ZhiHu-black?style=flat-square&logo=zhihu&logoColor=white)](https://www.zhihu.com/)

Other elements are the same. You can send network requests to certain third-party services that will return static or dynamic images to you. Then, you can render these images in a Markdown file.
